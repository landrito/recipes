# Mungo
Mungo is a simple Filipino bean stew.

## Ingredients
- 2 Cups Dry Mung Beans
- 2 Cups Dry Beluga (Black) Lentils
- 1 Cup Dry Wood Ear Mushrooms
- 1 Cup Dry shiitake Mushrooms Cut into bite sized pieces
- 14 Cups Water
- 4 Inch Finger of ginger peeled, sliced thin, and crushed in a garlic press
- 3 Cloves of garlic crushed
- 4 teaspoons of `Better than Bouillon` soup base
- 4 teaspoons of miso Paste
- 2 Handfuls of Spinach
- Reduced Sodium tamari (or Soy Sauce) to taste

### Notes
- Water
  - 3 Cups per Cup of Dry Mung Bean
  - 2 Cups per Cup of Dry Lentil
  - Additional water to give a stew consistency
- Garlic
  - I usually put a lot more because my family loves garlic
- Soup Base
  - I prefer the following:
    - 2 teaspoons `Reduced Sodium Vegetable`
    - 2 teaspoons `Garlic`
- Miso
  - Any color
  - Helps inhibit the negative effects of the salt in the soup base on blood pressure.

## Instructions
1. Place all ingredients except tamari and Spinach in an Instant Pot or Pressure cooker.
2. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
3. Depressurize and stir in Spinach to wilt.
4. Season to taste with tamari.
